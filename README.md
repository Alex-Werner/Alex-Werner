#### Currently maintained Open Source Project

- [Bifrost WSS](https://github.com/Alex-Werner/bifrost-wss) - Simple Client/Server pair for plug-and-play WebSocket Server with Auth and Rooms.
- [hermodlog](https://github.com/Alex-Werner/hermodlog) - Local contextual logger system that works even when transpiled for the browser.
- [TyrDB](https://github.com/Alex-Werner/tyrdb) - Fast, easy, and instant-to-use database. Similar to Mongo it uses a subset of its query system. Local FS (perfect for MVP condition before just switching to a cloud instance). Uses modified contextual B+Tree for indexing.
- [SBTree](https://github.com/Alex-Werner/sbtree) = Optimised document store using B+ Tree for fields. Adapters support for In-Memory and FileSystem

For any item out of this list, I should consider it stable, but contact me on Twitter (@obusco) if you need me to get a look at it; with more than 150 repos, I tend to overlook PR and issues! 

#### Currently self-financed side projects

- [WindfallerAI](https://github.com/WindfallerAI) - Financial digital assistant; Familly-office's services for all wallets. (RWA ready)
